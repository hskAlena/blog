# state-only demonstration

**Imitation Learning from Observations by Minimizing Inverse Dynamics Disagreement**

- upper bound of gap between LfD and LfO is revealed by a negative causal entropy which can be minimized in a model-free way.
- inverse-dynamics-disagreement-minimization

**LfO with GAIL**

- similar to GAIL but has replaced state-action to state transition (s,a) -> (s,s')
- JS divergence

**Model-based LfO**

- BCO
